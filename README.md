### Other stuff
| What does change in my Hide 'n Seek?                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The HUD is more simple and bit tinier like adding an outlined rects                                                                                                      |
| Removed almost every toggleable command and added another that finishes the round                                                                                        |
| Random starting seeker choices with the amount being scaled with connected players while making sure nobody is randomly chosen twice from the last round if there's more than two players |
| Some fix for hiders being caught during intermission                                                                                                                     |
